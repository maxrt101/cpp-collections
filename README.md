# Collections Library Using C++20 Concepts

## About
General idea was to implement few basic data structures with more convenient API than in standart library with the help of concepts.  
The library currenlty has `Array` and `List` implemented, which have `foreach`, `filter`, `reduce`, etc built-in as methods for convenience.  
There are also some python-inspired constructs, for example - generators, `range`, `zip`, `enumerate`, etc.
